      "body": "<h4>My name is Andrei Chira, and I'm starting this fundraiser on behalf of a very good friend of mine, Rhonda Kay.</h4>\n\n[Rhonda](https://steemit.com/@rhondak) is a professional editor and writer here on Steemit, and she's one of the best friends I have, but one of her true passions is care for rescue animals.  To that end, she started the Tazewell ARC to rescue dogs and other discarded animals in Tazewell, Virginia.  It's a non-profit that functions on donations exclusively, and out in her neck of the woods, charity for stray dogs is short.  No one seems to care.\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/FedcPbl.png</center>\n\nThe building she runs her animal rescue out of was built in the 1940's, and most of the wiring still uses cloth wires.  As such, she doesn't have any way to use modern heaters to keep her pets warm.  Anyone who's lived in the Virginia area knows it gets below freezing at night in the winter time, so this is a serious issue.  However, she does have one open outlet which she can convert to a modern outlet.  The trouble is, with her funds for TARC stretched to the absolute limit, she doesn't have any way to fund it.\n\n<h4>That's where you and I come in.</h4>\n\nWe can raise enough money together to install a new outlet and a heater that will keep her pets warm through those cold winter nights.\n\n<h2>Please send anything you can!  I've posted the GoFundMe link down below for direct donations.  All SBD posting rewards that this post receives will also be put to that purpose.  I set the goal at $1,000, but any amount that you can spare towards the goal of installing new wiring and a new heater is going to be appreciated!  Every little bit counts, and these dogs need your help! </h2>\n\n<center>https://www.gofundme.com/animal-rescue-building-improvements</center>\n",

      "body": "BlockTrades (http://blocktrades.us) has begun testing a new feature: the ability to purchase temporary delegations of Steem Power from our site using bitcoin, litecoin, and other currencies. Initially we’re offering 30 and 90 day delegation periods. The cost for a 30 day should be relatively similar to that offered by MinnowBooster, with some additional discount available  for 90 day delegations. Also we plan to shortly enable the ability to renew existing delegations from BlockTrades at a discounted rate.\n\nWhile it is not strictly necessary to create a BlockTrades account in order to purchase a Steem Power delegation, we strongly recommend it as this allows a user to have a record of the current expiration date of the delegation and will also allow for renewal of an existing delegation.\n\n##### Terms and Conditions for Steem Power Delegations\n\nWhile BlockTrades does not plan to directly oversee usage of the delegated Steem, we will investigate complaints of abuse by the community. BlockTrades reserves the right to terminate a user’s delegated Steem Power without refund if the user uses the delegation in a manner it considers harmful to the Steem community. The most common forms of abuse in this context would be: frequent upvoting of nearly contentless posts and/or plagiarism posts, targeted downvoting attacks on non-abusive community members, or phishing attacks aimed at defrauding other Steem users.\n\nOn the other hand, BlockTrades does not consider it abuse to upvote your own posts as long as they consist of original material that can be argued to have some meaningful content (even if it’s just an original joke).\n\n![btc_to_delegated_steem_power.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXeW8sndNKEV4dpiUrzoN6C8pnqG2pA7BEPHD5saobHat/btc_to_delegated_steem_power.png)",

I wish I could know \n all those reporting sweet words because it's been really sweet today.\n\nJust like we have the dating programmed to be the arrival of STEEMIAN across the country, I'm assuring you that it's just like that.\n\nI together with some fellow STEEMIAN arrived at Ile-Ife in the morning today, ( of course, I was going to mention names, LOL )..... Yeah! I left Ilesha City alongside with @harbysco, @royalfinest, and @bollutech.\n\nAll thanks to @maryfavour for making the journey a smooth one through the Mission To Minnow contest which I was able to win after the thoughtful free giver @turpsy chooses to opt out of the final nomination.\n\nBelow is our photo shoots\n\n![IMG_20171102_115455.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTn8rv15Ton3zYs8zM26fg3vdZ8w4WkznFMfpA4ZFy6Bz/IMG_20171102_115455.jpg)\nAbove is a group picture of I. @harbysco, @royalfinest and @bollutech.\n\n![IMG_20171102_115819.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQCLnGLVD6SkgiZxgD43s81o6XkCFSUhJkP6kguVvBRqT/IMG_20171102_115819.jpg)\nAbove is @royalfinest\n\n![IMG_20171102_120031.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZQtZ7g8uudZGFbcx99GpXH587xqJjHe3GH1QBbd2BrCB/IMG_20171102_120031.jpg)\nAnd the picture above is @honourmaus himself\n\n![IMG_20171102_120458.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZkcTxw743cD8DBEWxLBhqeX452HuGtopz1Qv2mTRvQea/IMG_20171102_120458.jpg)\nAbove is @bollutech caprured unaware\n\n![IMG_20171102_114653.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNjsewmgKsrMmnLSGDsBk1hKv9pm98qfZzpJMh2Un9R4f/IMG_20171102_114653.jpg)\nAbove is a picture of @harbysco and @royalfinest together taking a selfie\n\nIt's been fun actually..... Sincerely if you are not here you are missing....\n\nHummm.......\n\nAwait more update soon\n\n**(All picture were taken with Gionee s6 @ Hotel De Treasure)**",

      "title": "A New Social Media Blockchain Challenger Has Arrived! But Is It Any Threat To Steemit?",
      "body": "<center>https://static.pexels.com/photos/51415/pexels-photo-51415.jpeg</center>\n\nYesterday, after I got done with an [article](https://steemit.com/steemit/@jenkinrocket/synereo-and-akasha-how-the-only-semi-competitors-to-steemit-are-faring-1509568244-8744173) about what I thought were the only real threats to Steemit, I happened across something that made me sweat a little.\n\nBefore I go into it, I want to say that I think that it's *really, really* important for the Steemit community to keep its eyes on any would be usurpers to the throne. A lot of us have put a lot of time and energy into this platform, and we are **all** responsible for its success or failure. It's clear that the social sphere is going to have some dominating cryptocurrency unit in the future, and it's important we all work together to make sure Steem doesn't get blindsided by anything that has too many advantages over it. Steem is **great**, don't get me wrong. But we shouldn't assume everything is necessarily over, done with, and predetermined. These are early days for crypto. We're in the wild west and we need to make sure our gun arm is the fastest. \n\nThe new platform is called [Social X](https://socialx.network/), and it appears to be an app for smartphone a la Instagram. They still seem to be missing some important details on what their rewards system will look like so I wasn't *too* worried until I read this in its whitepaper:\n\n>Why​ ​we​ ​are​ ​different​ ​to​ ​STEEMIT\n\n>Steemit is a social network where its users post and share original content, usually in the form of text. The main feature of the platform is it’s built using a cryptocurrency upvote system: whenever a user upvotes another post, the user automatically sends a tiny amount of STEEM tokens to its author. Sadly, the backbone of the platform is somewhat complicated and can be hard for first time users to understand. **SocialX isn’t a competitor to STEEM in any way; however, we definitely think a cryptocurrency based upvote system is an interesting concept. As a result, we decided to bring it to the masses by combining blockchain with the winning features of popular image sharing sites.** We’ve also integrated a license management market, encrypted messenger and live stream functionality.\n\nWow. Not \"a competitor to STEEM in any way\"? Then, in nearly the same breath: \"however, we definitely think a cryptocurrency based upvote system is an interesting concept.... we decided to bring it to the masses...\"\n\n....\n\nWhat do they think Steem is doing? The whitepaper is either blatantly lying or missing the point: it's clear that one currency will dominate at the social sphere (if not, ultimately, the internet). And it sounds like these folks are making a play for top spot. \n\nThey seem to be taking the app route first, which is going to give them an enormous leg up considering that no Steemit-like app has managed to get an app working. If they get it working and it works great, nothing else may matter. Based on their [most recent update](https://socialx.network/update-week-38-39-2017/) the ICO launches somewhere in the next couple of weeks. Shortly after we can expect to hear about an app.\n\nSteemit has made some **fantastic** changes on the site as far as aesthetic appeal and functionality... but where are we on the app front? Mobile is going to be the stage on which we make or break. We do have some interesting apps in the pipeline, namely Zappl (which is close to an iOS app) and APPICS (which was recently announced, sounds *really* good, and if delivering on its promises would probably swat Social X like a gnat [but it just released it's whitepaper and we haven't really heard anything from them since]), but the former is starting with an iOS and the latter won't see the light of day for God only knows how long. \n\nThis could be a problem. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe there's no need to worry. I mean according to the whitepaper their current plans are to use the Ethereum blockchain which, despite the hype and the 'neatness' factor of it, doesn't really actually impress me that much because of it's inbuilt lack of scalability (at least from what I understand) - transaction times, it's ability to actually *process* it's contracts and events, transaction fees, etc. These are problems the Steem blockchain simply doesn't have. This is not even taking into account the inconceivable advantages SMT's will have over ERC20 - but again, feel free to correct me.\n\nI think there are even odds that these folks will find themselves either switching over to SMT's or wishing they had. Remember, AKASHA is built on the Ethereum blockchain and it seems to be stuck in development hell as its developers scratch their heads and consider how the hell they're actually going to get it to *work* (I feel pretty safe assuming that's why the platform hasn't really seen any changes). \n\nThere's probably nothing to worry about. Steemit and Steem have an incredible head start and a rock solid proof-of-concept. Steem is in a lot of hands, and that's a good thing. \n\nStill, there's probably nothing to worry about as far as someone entering your home without your permission at night. At least, statistically.

This is the first time in history that they've won the World Series and I must say that as a Houstonian I'm pretty excited about it. It's a shame I missed the game, but honestly they kind of won in the first few innings and pretty much just put a stopper on the Dodgers for the rest of the game (except for one point). \r\n\r\nAlright. NaNoWriMo. \r\n\r\nNaNoWriMo (National November Writer's Month) day 1 wasn't super productive in the way of writing, but I gots *reasons*. Generally speaking I like to dive right in as early as possible (if you do the math you realize that each and every day counts in a big way), but that isn't possible when you've decided to complete a work you'd started but haven't touched in a year or so. Said work had about 55,000 words in it, so I had to go back and at least read them once before starting. \r\n\r\nI got through most of it and plan on polishing it off, tonight. I don't think I'll get anywhere near the 3000 words I need to get back up to speed, but I'm going to try to do at least 500 or so. We'll see. \r\n\r\nAlso, there might be some relatively short posts as I crank up the fiction writing - we'll see. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm off to Writer's Glen.\r\n\r\nGo 'Stros!\r\n\r\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\r\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\r\n\r\n*Thursday, November 2nd, 2017*\r\n\r\nSource: [1](https://static.pexels.com/photos/261510/pexels-photo-261510.jpeg)",

Mmm.</sup></center>\nToday when I got on Steemit I didn't go jumping straight into my post writing as I usually do. Instead, I headed on down to the people I follow. I started by removing some of the ones who haven't posted things that I'm interested in commenting on or upvoting. Then I went through the posts, read them, and commented and upvoted the ones I liked. \n\nI feel great because of it, like the way you feel just after you've cleaned your house. Neat. Orderly. Accomplished. \n\nI feel pretty solid on my momentum making posts each day, and I'm getting to the point where I feel confident adding to that an hour of curation before my posts. It's hard to be 'a part of the conversation' so to speak, because you really do have to comment while a post is relatively new in order to participate in the conversation. However, for now, I'm not going to focus on that. I'm more concerned about commenting. After I get that down I can start worrying about where I comment. \n\nThe important thing is to engage with the community as a whole. \n\nSpeaking of community, I'm thinking of starting my own. I've already reserved a name, and I have a pretty fair idea about what I want to do with it. I've kind of got some ideas about who I'd like to invite to help me propagate and manage it, but I'm not sure how exactly I want to go about that (do I want to do a little initial growing of the community and see who's active, etc.). I'm actually *really* looking forward to getting it off the ground. \n\nI think these types of things are going to be really important in changing the face and vibe of Steemit. I've made many posts complaining about the narrowness of topic range on Steemit, especially as it pertains to which posts are the most successful (go look at the trending page... though I must say that it's gotten a **LOT** better and continues to do so). So I decided that it was high time to do something. More news on that front coming soon...\n\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\n\n*Monday, November 6th, 2017*\n\nSource: [1](https://static.pexels.com/photos/460736/pexels-photo-460736.jpeg)",

      "body": "<center>https://static.pexels.com/photos/261470/pexels-photo-261470.jpeg</center>\nIt's days like this, semi hung over and feeling strongly lackadaisical that it's hard to put together something resembling a post. It's times like this that I feel like Uma Thurman in that one scene from Kill Bill Where she's just escaped the hospital and is trying desperately to relearn moving her legs. \n\n*Wiggle your pinky toe.*\n*Wiggle your pinky toe.*\n\nAnd so, by momentum, or force of will, or wherewithal and what-have-you I am here writing what I am sure will be a magnificent study in saying absolutely nothing as prettily as possible. But I won't drag this out, forever. This is a short post, so I decree it. \n\nIt's my blog, I'm allowed to decree things. \n\nI watched an episode of The Tick today. I was surprised that it was actually pretty damn good. I'll probably finish it at some point. \n\nNaNoWriMo. \n\nUgh. Why did I let her convince me to do it this month? I'm so annoyed with myself. I know damn well that having two major commitments is a pretty good guarantee that one or even won't see completion. My hard goal is to post to Steemit everyday. When I've done that well for a few months (nearly there) I'll maybe add commenting daily to the mix. \n\nRight now I comment only when I'm of a mind, when I come across good posts, or when I'm in the mood to interact with the community. Or, I suppose, when folks comment on my stuff. \n\nSo I guess NaNoWriMo has officially become my soft goal - one that is lower on the priority ladder. I don't love it, as I'm not really a 'soft goals' kind of dude, but being realistic is also super important to me. Although I guess what I and what most people define as 'realistic' could be considered to be super different. \n\nI am going to write at least a little today, however. I wrote some yesterday, so that was good. \n\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\n\n*Sunday, November 5th, 2017*\n\nSource: [1](https://static.pexels.com/photos/261470/pexels-photo-261470.jpeg)",

      "body": "<center>https://static.pexels.com/photos/7112/woman-typing-writing-windows.jpg</center>\n\nIt's that time of the year once again, folks. [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org), National November Writer's Month. The deal is that during a grueling month of writing you attempt to complete a novel (or reach 50k words). There's a [site](https://nanowrimo.org), t-shirts, group events, and more. But none of that shit can save you once you commit. \n\nLast year I gave it a try with a story I shared here on Steemit about a generation ship in space. It was called [Generation Alpha Centauri](https://steemit.com/writing/@jenkinrocket/generation-alpha-centauri-part-1) and I got a good ways into it but fell short of the full 50k by more than 25k. The year before that I completed the challenge, wondering if I would ever decide to do something that insane, again. \n\nThe quality of the book isn't an issue. The issue is a promise that you make to yourself: I will complete my 50k words **no matter what!** And then each day you do your 2500 words or so (you technically only need to do 1666, but I can tell you that you *will* miss days and need to plan for this to avoid a horrible 4,000 word-a-day blitz near the month's end. \n\nEach day you sit down and write. There's no not feeling inspired, there's no pontificating endlessly over different permutations and directions that your story can take. You get it done. That's it. \n\nOn top of this my birthday is this month (and I likes to celebrate) so I've got to plan around that. And on top of *that* writing my novel won't even be my top priority each day: writing my posts for Steemit comes first. \n\nSo why not just post my story to the blockchain and kill two birds with one stone?\n\nWell, one issue is that I hope to submit this one for publishing.... which means I need to be able to take it down at a publisher's request. Not an option if the entire thing is on the blockchain. The second issue is that I've decided to finish a novel I've been writing rather than write a new one from scratch - I've got too many on the burner and it's high time I reached the finish line on one of them. \n\nThat means I'll be starting **mid story**. Not exactly friendly to new readers. If you're super curious about the story I'll be completing, you can find it [here](http://royalroadl.com/fiction/2160/deep-space-combat-school-nexus).\n\nPicking up an old story is, in many ways, *much* harder than starting a new one. This is why a lot of writers **never** finish their stories. But at some point you simply have to decide that it's time to go for gold. Real champs finish what they start and, god help me, I'm either a champ or really want to be. \n\nSo Day 1. \n\nMay God help us all. \n\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\n\n*Wednesday, November 1st, 2017*\n\nSource: [1](https://static.pexels.com/photos/7112/woman-typing-writing-windows.jpg)",

      "body": "<center>https://static.pexels.com/photos/34072/pexels-photo.jpg</center>\nAs I promised yesterday I completed reading my novel. Now that I'm caught back up to speed, today becomes my first official writing day!\n\nI wanted to write this after I stopped writing for the day, but I know that that realistically won't happen. I'll probably be tired of writing by then, and I have plans to play board games with @serenadesweetie and @bexrex62 (who totally lost her password and has to start a new account... I warned her!). \n\nI basically made the two of them get on Steemit, but haven't convinced them to make a post yet, much to my chagrin. Ah well, baby steps. \n\nAnyway, those of you who've been following my blog since near the beginning (if there are any of you left) know that I **absolutely fucking love** board games. So I'm really looking forward to crackin' open a few brews and matching wits with friends. I might post a few pics on Steemit or videos to dtube or sumthin'. We'll see. \n\nBut for the next hour or two... writing.\n\nI'll give you the stats, tomorrow.\n\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\n\n*Saturday, November 4th, 2017*\n\nSource: [1](https://static.pexels.com/photos/34072/pexels-photo.jpg)",

      "body": "<center>https://static.pexels.com/photos/7095/people-coffee-notes-tea.jpg</center>\n\nAs those of you who've been keeping up are aware, I've made a decision to complete a lengthy work rather than write a novel from scratch for NaNoWriMo. The thing is, since I haven't touched said piece in a while I've been having to catch myself back up to speed by reading the entire thing. It's 55k words, already about the length of a full novel (and past the requirement for NaNoWriMo of 50k words), and reading it all in a short space of time has been daunting - but surprisingly fun. \n\nI'll say that again: while the novel is, admittedly, a bit of a mess **I'm enjoying reading it**. At the time I was writing it though, I would get really frustrated and get really down on myself. The series was written as a series on [this site](https://royalroadl.com/fiction/2160/deep-space-combat-school-nexus) in a time before I had truly discovered Steemit.com, and it took a lot to post regularly for basically zero profit and a few comments (at best). I did get a few rabid fans, though.\n\nThe point is, I'm still reading it and hope to complete it today, after which I'll begin a mad dash game of catch up in order to give myself anything close to a shot at crossing the finish line. \n\nHopefully I'll get some words on the screen tonight, but I'm *definitely* going to finish reading before I go to sleep tonight. \n\nYou guys can hold me to that.\n\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\n\n*Friday, November 3rd, 2017*\n\nSource: [1](https://static.pexels.com/photos/7095/people-coffee-notes-tea.jpg)",

Of those I've been keeping my eye on most are either laughably inadequate (they work on a direct payment system of some sort or require some sort of financial investment on the part of the user) or their concept is interesting but it lacks anything resembling a complete implementation.\r\n\r\nTwo platforms in the latter category are Synereo and Akasha. I've spoken a bit about Akasha in the past and, to be honest, not a whole lot seems to have changed on that front. Akasha runs on the ever-popular Ethereum blockchain, but it doesn't quite seem to have a complete fix on what it is - neither do its users. Since downloading their desktop app a few months ago I've seen the platform change barely at all, not really making clear how the voting system works. However, when/if it does get working, it could be a potential threat to Steemit because of how popular Ethereum is. \r\n\r\nSynereo, on the other hand, has been pretty mysterious. Other than a few charts that seemed to detail a lot while revealing nothing there was not really any explanation for what it was. Welp, that's changed. They've officially released their app, and I must tell you with no small amount of glee: it's a fucking mess.\r\n\r\nYou go to their site, then to download the Wildspark extension for Chrome, and it takes you to a YouTube page explaining what the app does and how it works.... with a big sign up form over it. That's right, you have to click out of the sign up form in order to pause the video. \r\n\r\nI soldiered on despite the ridiculousness of this, but found that I couldn't create an account. In desperation I finally allowed it to connect via facebook (at this point Wildspark had already dealbroken itself several times) in order to finally see if it was worth looking into further. \r\n\r\nI really wish I knew, but right now I must admit that despite my best efforts Synereo defiantly refused to allow me to give it a try. That means, for now, it's totally worthless. However, much like Akasha, if they ever get their act together they might be a little bit of a threat. A simple extension is much easier to deal with than Steemit's sign up process. This is the advantage Synereo might have.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, however, I'm not too worried. I feel certain that neither will right their ships before next year, which will a thousand years from now be known as the dawn of SMT's (haha, at least I wish). Anyway, I'll let you guys know if anything changes. \r\n\r\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\r\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\r\n\r\n*Wednesday, November 1st, 2017*\r\n\r\nSource: [1](https://static.pexels.com/photos/163064/play-stone-network-networked-interactive-163064.jpeg)",

      "body": "<center>https://i.imgur.com/FHdg5LQ.jpg</center>\nThe new [steem.io](steem.io) site is so much clearer and more concise when it comes to describing Steem and Steemit that it actually cleared up some misconceptions that I didn't even know I'd had. \n\nIt's a little embarrassing, but I actually thought that Steem was going to be the backing for SMT's. That doesn't seem to be totally accurate based on what I understand after having read the steem.io page. \n\n**Steem** needs to be regarded as distinct from the **Steem blockchain**. **Steem** is a token on the **Steem blockchain**. The thing that the steem.io page drove home (by saying it outright) is that *steem can itself be regarded as an SMT*. It's special only because it's the first one. \n\nSMT's in general, however, will open up the **Steem blockchain**, and with the infusion of value raise the price of **Steem**.\n\nThis is everything as I understand it now. I think it's less wrong then what I thought before, anyway.\n\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\n\n*Friday, November 3, 2017*\n\nSource: screen capture by yours truly",

      "title": "The Question on Everyone's Mind: How Will SMT's (Smart Media Tokens) Effect The Price of Steem?",
      "body": "<center>https://i.imgur.com/SwI1vnC.jpg</center>\nYesterday I made a post about the new [steem.io](steem.io) website, talking about how it had helped me get clear on some misconceptions I'd had about Steem and the Steem blockchain. \n\nA good question was posited in the comments by @ammonite: \n\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/lIrb59M.jpg</center>\n\nIt made a question that had been bothering the peripheral vision of my minds' eye slap me straight on the face and plant a big, wet, unwanted kiss on my lips. How the hell will SMT's effect's Steems value?\n\nI'd wondered this, of course, but had always assumed the answer was that it would effect the price of the Steem token dramatically. Of course, that was based on my assumption that Steem would be 'backing' other SMT's, like a sort of gold standard for the internet, an idea I dispelled myself of [yesterday](https://steemit.com/steem/@jenkinrocket/the-new-steem-io-site-and-the-misconceptions-it-helped-clear).\n\nMoreover, on the steem.io site I saw this:\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/Vt0R4QM.jpg</center>\n\n<center>and this:</center>\n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/7SxAlVO.jpg</center>\n\nThis led me to the conclusion that Steem was just another SMT after all, and that there was not necessarily any reason why it would for sure be at all effected by SMT's. In fact, turning it over in my mind I began to worry that this might, in fact, clutter the market with a bunch of Steem clones that might end up attracting people to Steem or making them shy away from it. I'll admit to having the teeny, tiniest, moment of blind panic. \n\nI scavenged crypto forums and Quora after yesterday's second post, looking for an answer. I'll spare you all the ins and outs, because they didn't matter once I finally got some sense and took another look at the [SMT whitepaper](https://smt.steem.io/smt-whitepaper.pdf) and found this on page 56: \n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/mtECcoZ.jpg</center>\n\nIt turns out reading is good, and so is the SMT whitepaper table of contents (which clearly lists a large section describing how SMT's drive value into Steem). \n\nSigh.\n\nIn my defense, I did try looking at the whitepaper yesterday when the question first entered my mind, but it was on my phone and a combination of small text and the woes of finger scrolling large documents must've made me miss it. Glad I came back to it, though. \n\nSo, the answer to the question \"How will SMT's effect the price of Steem?\" is *they're most likely going to drive it sky-high*. The reasons are described in the whitepaper and I would go into them here but... well, NaNoWriMo, remember? Besides, the SMT/Steem section is fairly long, and I expect that there'll be some really interesting things there (from my perusal of it). It'd probably make this post pretty unweildly, so we'll respect the topic by giving it its own space. I'll take a dive into it later though, don't you worry. \n\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\n\n*Saturday, November 4th, 2017*\n\nSource: Screen capture by yours truly (@jenkinrocket).",

      "body": "<center>https://i.imgur.com/fSLtJlE.png</center>\n\nThe other day I see a post from @anarcho-andrei (who you should totally vote for as [witness](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@anarcho-andrei/anarcho-andrei-the-witness), by the way) that mentions that he's posting from some new Steem app called [Zappl](https://zappl.com/#!/Home).\n\nIt's a Twitter-like that makes posts of 240 characters or less to the Steem blockchain. I checked it out and was pretty floored at how cool it was. How long had this been brewing behind the scenes? Had I seen it already, but sort of dismissed and forgotten about it? It did *familiar*, so I'm pretty sure I've at least heard about it before. But here it is, in all it's resplendent glory. \n\nThis is a *real* contender against Twitter, folks - and this is only the first iteration of the platform. The real test will come with the iOS (and hopefully quickly after the Android) app. So far though, I've gotta say, it's lookin' real good. The Steem blockchain is barely on its second year, and we've already come this far. This is absolutely insane. \n\nGood fucking God. There's such an electricity in the air when a new project launches on the Steem blockchain, or when something like SMT's get announced (hoping on another SMT update around mid to late November and from then on monthly until they launch - I would think they'd want to keep the hype up).\n\nBut there's a question. And this question is being introduced by Zappl to the Steem blockchain community for the first time: **should users start new accounts for Zappl use, exclusively?**\n\nIt's a good question, and I already see the community rolling it around in their mouths like a good wine, mulling it over as they pour another glass. On the one hand, why in the world would you split your risk splitting your user base if your blog isn't one of the better known ones on the site? It seems to me that the way Steem and it's related platforms work reward a laser-like approach to social media. Focus on building your SP in one account in order to really reap the benefit and be able to more easily share it with others. \n\nOn the other hand, there is the idea of clutter. If you're going to be posting ten times a day, maybe everyone in your feed doesn't want to see that, especially if your account is super focused on a certain topic or is basically already famous..... But on the *other* other hand (I have many hands) each post you make will be short and if you don't include a photo it shouldn't take up an annoying amount of space (for this reason Zappl users probably shouldn't bother using stock photos to make their posts more attractive, it's likely to have the opposite effect - just as in Twitter). \n\nIt's a good question. I think, for my own part, I'll be making posts from this account until I feel fairly certain I'll be posting to that platform often (there's not been an Android app announced yet, and the site doesn't seem to work particularly well on my phone - or at all [and it's a new phone]). \n\nThoughts?\n\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\n\n*Tuesday, October 31st, 2017*\n\nSource: [1](https://steemit-production-imageproxy-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/DQmRNh35iLdhFHGvGcR2XKrFhVgxdz5BHC3VuMcfaC1N8es)",

[Busy.org](busy.org) is a little more of a Facebook competitor, and now we have [Zappl](https://zappl.com) which competes with Twitter). Now we have a platform that is here to *improve* upon another: [Utopian.io](https://utopian.io/). \r\n\r\nUtopian.io seems basically to be Steemit for open source programmers and enthusiasts. I won't pretend that I understand everything going on on the front page, but I do know that this is the first platform of it's kind ever to exist... and it's poised to be a major game changer. \r\n\r\nEvery year, millions (if not billions) of dollars' worth of open source programming is developed and maintained, and most of it for free. These hard-working individuals bust their tails to develop such tools as the Apache Open Office Suite, Blender 3d, Wikipedia, and Gimp. And every year that have to come the public, hat in hand, to beg for scraps so that they can keep the lights on. And a disturbing amount of people are either to stingy or too poor to actually lend them a hand. \r\n\r\nWell... the Steem blockchain is a stupidly obvious solution to this problem. Fans and users can upvote worthwhile products and give to their the people they want to support most while actually *gaining* themselves in the process. It's a win-win. It's an exciting time for the Steemit blockchain, folks. \r\n\r\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\r\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\r\n\r\n*Tuesday, October 31st, 2017*\r\n\r\nSource: [1](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1508424145/plzpwesio3kgpu1ew9v9.jpg)",

      "body": "<center>https://i.imgur.com/s0Cbm7x.jpg</center>\r\nIt's beginning to feel like a new blockchain social media platform is announced nearly every other week, nowadays. The latest is [view.ly](view.ly). \r\n\r\nView.ly is a YouTube-like, a platform that is meant to do all of the things that YouTube does (only, in this case, in a decentralized way). The main site shows an app, implicating that this is the direction it plans on taking first. However, much like the other app I talked about recently, Social X, it is on the Ethereum blockchain (or currently plans on being so). \r\n\r\nThis makes me think there's nothing to worry about, as no one has found out how to run a site like Steemit on the Ethereum blockchain successfully (though many are trying - AKASHA and Social X, to name a few others). This is currently because the ERC20 tokens are the best alternative to making your own token from scratch.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that kind of bothers me is the fact that we already have a blockchain YouTube like that works: [D-Tube](https://d.tube/). What's more, one of the founders is @furion, a steemian with a great tech background who should be very aware that SMT's are on the horizon and should also be aware of D-Tube. \r\n\r\nSo why stick to ERC20? Is it something they're just saying now for the ICO's sake but plan on reconsidering later? There are a lot of questions, but I see a similar trend in other whitepapers being mentioned at this point in time. \r\n\r\n<center>Follow: @jenkinrocket</center>\r\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/xPC7p5N.png</center>\r\n\r\n*Monday, November 6th, 2017*\r\n\r\nSource: Screen cap by yours truly.",

      "title": "A Review Of Ever Oasis For Nintendo 3DS!",
      "body": "![ever oasis review nintendo 3ds](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT575RiKnRKmvimMQoAq8D8oter2VUDbBUjBgLwkS4K8Y/image.png)\n\nToday, I'm going to do a review of one of my favorite Nintendo 3DS titles. Ever Oasis takes place in a harsh desert climate. You play as a Seedling, the only beings who can grow new life in this wasteland. As one of the children of the Great Tree you can commune with water spirits as well. This will enable you to create an Oasis which will draw new visitors from all over the world to visit and trade with you!\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbTydmWQwY2KiQxjNP4qnFEnhN2xMrGW9m3jVo92eNT2g/image.png)\n\nThis title is a delightful mixture of several genres. When playing Ever Oasis you'll split your time between RPG style adventures in the game's many dungeons, solving fun puzzles and building the community in your Oasis. As the chief of the Oasis you'll be in charge of growing the local economy and recruiting new residents to join your tribe.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPze1b58yhDkngJShvRRf3xfWfKfc7L5ofdKQELyhv7Xk/image.png)\n\nYour house is near the spirit tree, and you'll start every in game \"day\" here. Ever Oasis operates on a cycle of night and day and the enemies you face will differ at these times. The monsters can also be stronger at night, but it's easy to advance your game to the next day simply by sleeping. Shops will also close down for the night, effectively limiting some of your activities, but you're free to explore dungeons at all hours with no ill effects I've seen.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVN1vgwJPEAgFExyhvrR73EMs3hkhuYFcYEcgRN58WJhJ/image.png)\n\nOn the top floor of your tree house you'll be able to do something much cooler. Here you have access to a Synthesis Tree that will allow you to make new items. This nifty little feature will allow you to turn raw ingredients and treasures you come across in your travels into weapons or useful items. Sometimes you'll need to unlock these \"recipes\" by completing objectives. You'll spend a good amount of time hunting down rarer ingredients needed for better weapons.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQme4P3BwUTwWGFHoPGwfMMrqA7ZEXYoHQpMBotZTEWa6ay/image.png)\n\nDuring your travels you'll meet many characters who come from different settlements and tribes. A good number of them can become members of your tribe, but you'll have to work for it. Typically you'll either have to complete some type of errand that requires you go through a complex dungeon. In other cases though they will show up as a visitor if you have certain shops in your Oasis. \n\nEach character has different abilities or skills you'll need to do certain tasks in the village or to navigate your way through obstacles. If you're out of ideas on where to find new friends try talking to your current residents. Often times they will give you a tip to let you know where to find someone.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbXKBC4XHrkiErjjLnV9W5V9CwJ4HTSdYaeZtKa166djy/image.png)\n\nMost, but not all the characters you recruit will want to open up a shop in your Oasis. If you have adequate space and the proper number of dewadems you can build a new food, clothing or novelty shop. The shopkeeper will handle the sales, but you will be tasked with stocking the shelves with materials. This can quickly become a daunting task when you start to get a good number of shops to keep up with! You will however get a cut of the sales which can help you expand your Oasis.\n\nYou should always try to keep your shops fully stocked. Having shops that are empty can negatively effect the happiness level of your residents and the happiness level of your Oasis is directly tied to your health when you go adventuring. \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRTN9tr2ViQ8u7ezPk7UYHYD4oXCE4Puz5nLZdrZhPVbe/image.png)\n\nFortunately, soon you'll be able to utilize trading to help you get materials a little easier. This means you can choose to visit only a couple areas and then trade that loot for other items. I've heard some people say that the shop stocking was repetitive and boring I very much like these types of tasks. Be aware that you will spend a lot of time managing your residents so if you don't like that then this game might not be for you. However, later on it is pretty easy to manage your shop inventory through other means so you can spend most of your time in the dungeons.\n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTyAHPGzx9aVjJBSWWX9a9aPEq7gxttZUH8AYMS4MHWUH/image.png)</center>\n\nWhile these charming little noots are happy to spend all their dewadems at your Oasis they will unfortunately not join your settlement. \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbR9bRJppsP9aBtr5pVTwkWLfEpJatr6uh9hJRQqu9DJz/image.png)\n\nOne of my favorite features is the festival events! These events are useful in two ways. First, they can bring a lot of money into your Oasis. Be aware that after a festival almost all your shops could be sold out so you'll be busy the next day replenishing them! Second, they can also attract new visitors that would otherwise not come but mostly I just think they're fun. \n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmP8xiPPp6p87dpbfLWEtpLzL76o945jfLUVgrmY1dQvqm/image.png)</center>\n\nThe combat system features a character swapping set up that works pretty well honestly. It works much better than other games I've played in this style. You can quickly swap between three characters to take advantage of different weapon types and other advantages. The two you aren't currently using will act as NPCs, which aren't too terrible. Just make sure you're using the targeting feature to keep them focused. Otherwise if you make a pit stop for healing or practically anything else they will follow right next to you drawing aggro!\n\nYou can use the B button to dodge, and you'll need to utilize this frequently to avoid getting clobbered. If you find yourself low on HP I've found it's best to swap to a new character as they seem to be good at defending themselves as NPCs. If a team member does go down you can revive them by smashing the A button quickly. They can also recover on their own, but I like to get them up quicker. Have that dodge roll ready as this is a good way to get flattened by a charging enemy.\n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUTrnhBUMCqh6NWVGN6wEKgyDaJWzBpENn3JVyCBD3T1D/image.png)</center>\n\nEarlier I mentioned that your Oasis residents have special skills! You'll be using those to get through various obstacles in the dungeons. Each of these will require a specific type of skill to pass. If you don't seem to have anybody who can do it you'll need to wait until you get a resident who does have this skill. This part is honestly a little annoying. There's no way to complete a dungeon 100% on the first pass through. You'll never have all the skills. \n\nSince you can only have three party members you may also find you need to swap them mid way to get everything. This is obviously infuriating so they made a quick fix by use of the aqua gate. This portal system allows you to teleport back to the Oasis for new party members. This way you can quickly pick up some treasures or progress even if it is a bit irritating. You can also use this as a 'bookmark' if you need to save. Keep in mind that if you accept a resident request that has to put a location on your map this will be overwritten, and you'll need to start over!\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmfRRVsbx7MhtcsBNsnXzS1nxNtTmLGgzkhV1kVKXixUZg/image.png)\n\nEver Oasis is an enjoyable title for all ages, and it's an excellent addition to any Nintendo 3DS library. If you enjoy dungeons and community building you'll like this game. I really enjoyed managing all my shops and hunting for new residents. My only real complaint is having to stop part way through a dungeon to get new party members, but it is tolerable. Especially since the rest of the game is so fun. This might be tied with Monster Hunter Generations for my favorite Nintendo 3DS titles, and it's certainly worth playing.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSrsRrKFXmwD7XopnhKXErHSaR8xsv4YdEyH8qopKgW5r/image.png)",
